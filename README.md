# Community-Tile-Pack
A collection of custom Lua blocks that can be used freely in other mods.

Includes a single level demonstrating each custom Lua tile.

## How to use
1. Copy the "Modules" directory into your own mod, at the root directory
2. include the module in your Lua level file with `requires`. EG:
    ```
    local death_blocks = require("Modules.JawnGC.death_blocks")
    ```
3. When loading your level, activate the mod. EG:
    ```
        death_blocks.activate(level_state)
    ```
3. When unloading your level, deactivate the mod. Not all mods need to deactivate. EG:
    ```
        death_blocks.deactivate()
    ```
4. Look at `dwelling1.lua` for examples on using `requires` and activating the mods.

Checkpoints work a little differently - I encourage you to check out the code in `dwelling1.lua` to see how to implement checkpoints.

Let me know if you need any help working with these mods.
